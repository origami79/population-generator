    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Just a personal project I've been tinkering with for the past few years on how to randomly generate a relatively realistic medieval (or medieval inspired fantasy) population. I already have a semi-functional setup, but it currently runs off spreadsheets and a CodePen that I copy data between. This is an attempt to homogonize and improve the process.
